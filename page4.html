                Programming is important to accelerate device input and output operations, automate data, information collection, management, calculation and accurate analysis of data, and create programs and applications that help computer and mobile users in daily life. For all these reasons, it is really important to know how to use programming languages in our daily life.

                Programming languages are very important, and the proof of this is that many programmers strive to discover what is new and what is related to it. The importance of programming lies in the following:

                    We can use it to speed up the device's input and output operations, automate data and information processing, collection, management, calculation and accurate analysis, and create programs and applications that help computer and laptop users in daily life.

                    Without programming languages, today we will not be able to use the Internet well, whether on the computer or smart phones.

                    We can reap a lot of profits from working in programming and getting to know more than one programming language.

                    Programmers use a number of automatic codes that increase their productivity, thus saving time and effort and increasing profit. Saving time and effort and increasing profit.
